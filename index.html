  <p>Filmed over four years, in 25 countries, <cite>Samsara</cite> is an unforgettable and unparalleled visual journey that will change the way you see the world, and will make you deeply homesick for places you've never been.</p>
  <p>Directed by Ron Fricke, a filmmaker known for stunning time-lapse cinematography in the films <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi">Koyaanisqatsi</a></cite> and <cite>Samsara</cite>'s predecessor <cite>Baraka</cite>, the film is a non-linear, non-verbal documentary that visually explores the Sanskrit term "samsara," which has many definitions; among them: wandering through/flowing on, impermanence, the cycle of rebirth/growth/decay/redeath.</p>
  <p>While <cite>Samsara</cite> doesn't literally follow said cycle, it guides the viewer through a dizzying mix of time-lapse scenery from around the world, interspersed with people from various nations directly addressing (even confronting) the camera. For me, some of the most moving scenes were the most mundane: the Lotte Kasai golf club in Tokyo, the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai, an anonymous meat processing plant somewhere in Asia.</p>

  <p>Why is <cite>Samsara</cite> so affecting? The sheer weight of the world's beauty, for one thing; my utter ignorance of so much of it, for another. <cite>Samsara</cite> is designed as a gently guided meditation session; each image that comes up is so like a thought, or a feeling, or a story experienced on the meditation cushion: brilliant and compelling and ultimately fleeting, impossibly unreal. Watching Samsara is an exercise in knowing that it will end; that each scene you wanted to savor will pass, that each face you were just getting to know will vanish. It's a beautiful lesson in impermanence, and leaves me feeling as though I've journeyed a thousand miles in less than 100 minutes.</p>
